# Read Me

Experiments are done by running
`python3 -m clrs.examples.run2`
and selecting, in the same file, the desired architecture. 

Very similarly to the original code base, https://github.com/google-deepmind/clrs, SheafNet experiments are run with the architecture `sheaf`, while DeltaNet experiments are run with `heisenberg2d`.
The desired algorithms are selected from the algorithm list in the same file.

# Declaration
This code builds on top of the following public repositories:
1. https://github.com/google-deepmind/clrs
2. https://github.com/pablomlago/clrs-ls65

My main contributions to the code base are:
1. Implementation of the Sheaf architecture (SheafNet in the report)
2. Implementation of the heisenberg2d architecture (DeltaNet in the report)
